# Photon

Photon is the designated fee token for the AtomOne network, introduced to separate transactional functions from governance and staking activities. This design choice aims to enhance security and provide a more stable economic model for the network. ([AtomOne](https://atom.one/faq/))

#### **Why Photon?**

In traditional blockchain models, the same token often serves multiple roles, including governance, staking, and transaction fees. AtomOne diverges from this approach by introducing Photon exclusively for transaction fees, allowing for:

* **Economic Clarity**: By separating fee payments from governance and staking, Photon helps maintain the integrity and stability of the ATONE token.
* **Enhanced Security**: This separation reduces potential conflicts of interest and aligns incentives more effectively across different network participants.

#### **Current Status and Future Plans**

* **Fee Payments**: Currently, Photon is used for all transaction fees within the AtomOne network.
* **ATONE to Photon Conversion**: A burn mechanism has been established to convert ATONE to Photon, facilitating the transition to Photon as the sole fee token.
* **Integration with DAOs**: As AtomOne's DAO structures become operational, Photon is expected to play a central role in funding and executing various initiatives within the network.

These developments underscore AtomOne's commitment to refining blockchain governance and economic models. By introducing Photon and emphasizing decentralized decision-making, AtomOne seeks to offer a more secure and adaptable platform within the Cosmos ecosystem.
