# AtomOne

In October 2024, AtomOne emerged as a fork of the Cosmos Hub, aiming to address concerns about centralization and governance within the Cosmos ecosystem. This initiative was largely a response to Cosmos Hub Proposal 848, which proposed capping ATOM's inflation rate at 10%. Many community members, including Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon, opposed this change, fearing it could undermine network security and validator incentives.

#### **Key Developments Since Launch**

* **GovGen Chain Initiation**: Before AtomOne's official launch, the GovGen chain was established to gauge community sentiment and shape the new network's foundational principles. This governance-only chain allowed stakeholders to vote on critical aspects like the constitution, tokenomics, and software choices.
* **ATONE Token Distribution**: Upon launch, AtomOne distributed 96.99 million ATONE tokens to ATOM holders, with additional allocations to a community pool and the AtomOne Treasury DAO. ([BlockBeats](https://www.theblockbeats.info/en/flash/267491))
* **Constitutional Governance**: AtomOne operates under a written constitution, emphasizing decentralized decision-making and community involvement. This framework aims to enhance transparency and ensure that governance reflects the collective vision of its participants. ([AtomOne](https://atom.one/faq/?utm_source))
* **Validator Voting Rights Reform**: To promote a more equitable governance structure, AtomOne removed voting rights tied to delegated tokens, ensuring that only validators' self-staked tokens influence governance decisions.

#### **Looking Ahead**

AtomOne plans to implement several features to further its mission:

* **Interchain Security (ICS) Enhancements**: Developing a more equitable validator reward system to prevent excessive delegation to high-power validators and promote a balanced validator set.
* **DAO Activation**: Establishing key decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), including the Steering, Oversight, and Treasury DAOs, to manage various aspects of the network's operations.
* **Photon Integration**: Transitioning to Photon as the sole fee token for transactions, further separating governance and transactional functions within the network.

### **Photon**&#x20;

Photon is the designated fee token for the AtomOne network, introduced to separate transactional functions from governance and staking activities. This design choice aims to enhance security and provide a more stable economic model for the network. ([AtomOne](https://atom.one/faq/))

#### **Why Photon?**

In traditional blockchain models, the same token often serves multiple roles, including governance, staking, and transaction fees. AtomOne diverges from this approach by introducing Photon exclusively for transaction fees, allowing for:

* **Economic Clarity**: By separating fee payments from governance and staking, Photon helps maintain the integrity and stability of the ATONE token.
* **Enhanced Security**: This separation reduces potential conflicts of interest and aligns incentives more effectively across different network participants.

#### **Current Status and Future Plans**

* **Fee Payments**: Currently, Photon is used for all transaction fees within the AtomOne network.
* **ATONE to Photon Conversion**: A burn mechanism has been established to convert ATONE to Photon, facilitating the transition to Photon as the sole fee token.
* **Integration with DAOs**: As AtomOne's DAO structures become operational, Photon is expected to play a central role in funding and executing various initiatives within the network.

These developments underscore AtomOne's commitment to refining blockchain governance and economic models. By introducing Photon and emphasizing decentralized decision-making, AtomOne seeks to offer a more secure and adaptable platform within the Cosmos ecosystem.
