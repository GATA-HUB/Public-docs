# ICS 2.0 PSS ( Partial Set security)

Permissionless Interchain Security (ICS) represents the next step in the evolution of blockchain interoperability by enabling anyone to launch a chain on the Hub without needing permission.

Initially, the first version of ICS, known as Replicated Security (RS), required a governance proposal to add a consumer chain, as top 95% validators had to run each consumer chain. However, with the advent of ICS 2.0 (PSS), most consumer chains will use "opt-in security," allowing validators to choose whether to run a given consumer chain. This change aims to facilitate the permissionless creation of consumer chains through a simple transaction rather than a governance proposal.

Currently, although the technology theoretically supports permissionless creation, governance proposals are still used due to the need for codebase refactoring. The developers plan to address this soon and are open to community input on whether chain creation should remain governance-gated.

Consumer chains will also feature "ownership," enabling a DAO or the chainâ€™s on-chain governance to control various settings. This includes setting the chain's start time, modifying validator lists, and adjusting the number of validators. These features allow for greater flexibility and control over the chain's operations, ensuring it can be tailored to specific needs and circumstances.\
