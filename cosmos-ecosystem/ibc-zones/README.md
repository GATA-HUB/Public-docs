# IBC Zones

IBC Zones are independent blockchains connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem. Each zone operates autonomously with its own validators and governance but can send tokens, data, and messages securely to other zones. This modular design enables a network of sovereign chains to interoperate seamlessly, allowing decentralized applications and assets to move freely across chains without needing centralized bridges. IBC Zones are the backbone of Cosmos' vision of an "**Internet of Blockchains**."
