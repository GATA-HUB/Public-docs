<summary><strong>Where are the funds of this Yield series coming from?</strong></summary>

The funds for the revenue generation of Yield Paws are coming from the original mint of the collection. 80% of the mint funds are used for [yield generation](./#concept-of-yield-paws-funding-model-and-distribution) exclusively.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where does the Yield come from?</strong> </summary>

The yield of Yield Paws comes from a mix of \
• DeFi activities like LPing, borrowing & lending (60-70%)\
• private sales-related activities (20-25%)\
• staking rewards (10-15%)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where do you stake the funds? Where are staking rewards accrued?</strong></summary>

The portion of yield that comes from staking rewards gets accrued on the [GATA HUB validator](../../gata-validators/) for Stargaze. By doing this, not only YP holders are benefiting from staking rewards, but GATA infrastructure as well and Stargaze as a whole, as these funds are getting used to secure the whole network.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Are all NFTs giving monthly yield? Which traits give which kind of yield share?</strong> </summary>

Yes, all Yield Paws NFTs are providing you with yield / revenue share each month.

The individual amount of yield per NFT gets determined by its rarity class, which is based on the fur trait:&#x20;

* Brown Fur: 9% of yield   &#x20;
* Grey Fur: 13.5% of yield&#x20;
* Black Fur: 16% of yield&#x20;
* White Fur: 18% of yield&#x20;
* Orange Fur: 43.5% of yield

<summary><strong>What kind of DeFi activities are used to get yield and on which platforms?</strong></summary>

The GATA team manages the Yield series funds for you and puts around 60-70% of all funds to work in various DeFi activities according to [yield model](./#concept-of-yield-paws-funding-model-and-distribution).&#x20;

Some of these activities include the use of funds for liquidity pooling and for borrowing & lending. For these activities, we use DeFi platforms like Osmosis, Kujira, Uniswap, Raydium and other platforms.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Which token assets are you LPing in / with?</strong> </summary>

The GATA team is focusing on these token assets for liquidity pools: \
ETH, BTC, SOL, ATOM, USDC/T and more

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>I have minted/bought yield NFTs, but how can I exit?</strong></summary>

You can exit your position on yield NFTs anytime by either

&#x20;• selling it on the secondary market on Stargaze or&#x20;

• swapping your NFTs to STARS via infinity swap pool instantly

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the <strong>"Infinity Swap Pool"? How does it work? Can I buy/sell YP NFTs with that?</strong></summary>

The infinity swap pool contains both STARS and Yield NFTs. You can use it to swap your assets in both directions at any given time, without the need for manual trading on the secondary market on Stargaze. The smart contract of the infinity pool swap takes care of that for you.&#x20;

• Buy Yield Paws NFTs: Select an amount of STARS and swap that to Yield Paws NFTs.&#x20;

• Sell Yield Paws NFTs: Select a number of Yield Paws NFTs and swap those into STARS

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the "Buy &#x26; Burn" program and how does it work?</strong></summary>

Each month, 5% of all yield generated gets used to buy Yield Paws NFTs at floor. These NFTs get burned right after. This leads to a supply reduction and higher individual shares of yield for the rest of the collection items.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the "Yield Raffle" and how does it work?</strong> </summary>

Each month, 5% of all yield generated gets raffled among all holders. A total of 3 winning IDs will get drawn randomly. The 5% of yield will get split between the winning IDs and transferred to their holders wallet. Each yield series NFT is one ticket to the Yield Raffle, regardless of rarity, fur color or any other factor (one NFT = one ticket).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>80% of mint funds are going into yield generation - what happens to the rest?</strong></summary>

Of the original mint funds of Yield Paws, 10% go to the collection's infinity pool on SG to jumpstart trading activities and to give exit opportunities to minters from day 1. The other 10% of mint funds go to the GATA team to cover all expenses related to launch & administration.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Do you have a goal for a set base APR? If so, why is the GATA team taking that risk?</strong></summary>

Yes, our goal is to provide a baseline APR of around \~20%. The returns throughout the epochs might vary, but to achieve this, and potentially more, this is the set base target we're focusing on. The GATA team has gained experience in yield management over the course of the past 2 years and therefore, we believe that this goal is realistic & achievable.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>When will the first rewards get distributed? Wen Yield epoch rewards?</strong></summary>

The first distribution of monthly epoch rewards for Yield Paws will be on **May 1st 2024**.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why should I mint this NFT when I could manage these funds by myself?</strong></summary>

While it's possible to replicate many of the yield strategies encompassed within the yield model, such as liquidity provisioning and staking, effectively managing these positions demands significant time and expertise. It's important to factor in fees, which can disproportionately affect the performance of smaller positions.&#x20;

Additionally, our yield model encompasses certain features, such as access to private sales, which are typically inaccessible to individuals.

In summary, Yield Kittens present a distinct opportunity to engage in DeFi without the complexities of identifying lucrative opportunities and continually monitoring and adjusting positions to maximize yield.
