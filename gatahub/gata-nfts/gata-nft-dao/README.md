# GATA NFT DAO

GATA DAO is an NFT DAO allows the owners of GATA NFTs ([GATAc](about-gata-nfts/#colonial-cats-gatac) & [GATAv](about-gata-nfts/#voyager-cats-gatav)) to participate and influence the decision-making of the DAO. GATA DAO has been formed to own and operate [GATA validators](../../gata-validators/) which infact are and will be the property of the DAO.&#x20;

So, by owning a [GATA NFT](about-gata-nfts/) you are either owning or are founding a validator that gives you the utility of commission earnings derived from running the validator in proportion to your NFT ownership. This is in addition to the value of the art that the owners hold.

Furthermore, this also includes the utility of earning royalties derived from a share of the trading fee of the NFTs on their respective marketplaces. Therefore, the holders of [GATA NFTs](about-gata-nfts/) enjoy the benefit of community engagement via running the DAO, earning from validators and royalties on top of their individual staking rewards.

### GATA DAO Objectives

#### To operate as an NFT DAO

GATA DAO aims to function as a decentralized autonomous organization that leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to govern its operations. The DAO's members collectively own the [validator nodes](../../gata-validators/) on various sovereign blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem, and the NFT holders have a stake in the DAO's revenue streams.

#### To generate passive income for NFT holders

By owning [GATA NFTs](about-gata-nfts/), holders can receive a share of the [DAO's revenue](dao-revenue-distribution/dao-revenue-share-model.md), enabling them to earn passive income without actively participating in the organization's operations. The DAO generates revenue by running [validators](../../gata-validators/) on different blockchains, staking different assets, and NFT holders get benefits from these revenue streams in form of [monthly epoch rewards](dao-revenue-distribution/).

#### To give back to the community

GATA DAO aims to be a community-driven organization that is focused on creating value for its members. By enabling holders of [GATA NFTs](about-gata-nfts/) to earn [passive income](dao-revenue-distribution/), the DAO is giving back to its community members and rewarding them for their participation in the organization.

#### To provide governance for the Cosmos ecosystem

As a validator node operator on different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem, GATA DAO aims to provide reliable and secure infrastructure to support the development of the blockchain ecosystem. The DAO will use its collective governance power to make decisions that benefit the Cosmos community as a whole.
