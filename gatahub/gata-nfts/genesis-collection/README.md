# Genesis Collection

NFT collections of the GATA Series were the first NFTs of GATA HUB. They consist of twocollections:

* [Colonial Cats](./#colonial-cats-gatac) (shortened to: "GATAc")
* [Voyager Cats](./#voyager-cats-gatav) (shortened to: "GATAv")

Holding any NFTs from these two core collections grants the holder voting rights within GATA DAO and provides access to GATA's monthly epoch rewards (the distribution of revenue to stakeholders).&#x20;

Colonial Cats (GATAc) is the very 1st GATA series NFT collection of GATA DAO and was launched on Stargaze launchpad on March 11th 2022.&#x20;

Out of 700 applicants, just 15 projects were short-listed by the Stargaze team and Colonial Cats was one of them. Therefore, GATAc is one of the few actual genesis collections on Stargaze.

Supply: 999 GATAc&#x20;
