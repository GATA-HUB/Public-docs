## Utility of Yield Paws

• Epoch Rewards (80% of yield revenue gets distributed to YC holders in $SOL and $yGATA)

• [Buy & Burn](yield-paws/yield-paws-faqs.md#what-is-the-buy-and-burn-program-and-how-does-it-work) program (10% of yield gets used to sweep floor & to reduce supply continuously)&#x20;

• [Yield Raffle](yield-paws/yield-paws-faqs.md#what-is-the-yield-raffle-and-how-does-it-work) (10% of yield gets raffled with 3 random YCs winning; each YC = 1 ticket)

## Monthly Yield Revenue & Trait-Based Yield Distribution&#x20;

Yield Paws holders benefit from monthly distributions of revenue gained from the yield model activities, the so called **epoch rewards**. These are **$SOL $yGATA** which get distributed directly to the wallets of holders. You just need to hold your kitties tightly: **no staking is needed** to be eligible for these monthly epoch rewards.

The **individual yield share per NFT** gets determined by the **Skin colors** of your kitties. There are **5 different colors** with **5 different yield share values**. The rarer your Crocs, the higher your rewards: \
