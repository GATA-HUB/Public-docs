## Utility of PengOnes&#x20;

Each month, PengOnes collection by GATA HUB will provide you with&#x20;

• **Epoch Rewards** (70% of yield revenue gets distributed to PengOnes holders )

• **Yield Raffle** (10% of yield gets raffled with 3 random POs winning; each POs = 1 ticket)

## Monthly Yield Revenue & Trait-Based Yield Distribution&#x20;

PengOne holders benefit from monthly distributions of revenue gained from the yield model activities, the so called **epoch rewards**. The Yield gets distributed directly to the wallets of holders. You just need to hold your Penguines tightly: **no staking is needed** to be eligible for these monthly epoch rewards.

The **individual yield share per NFT** gets determined by the **Skin colors** of your Penguine. There are 3 **different yield share values**. and a super rare 1/1s. The rarer your penguine, the higher your rewards:&#x20;

## Yield Bonus

#### 1. Eligibility Overview

* **Categories**: PengOnes are classified into **Base**, **Pro**, **Apex**, and **1/1s**. Base yields differ across classifications; bonus rules apply equally to all.
* **Epoch duration**: Bonus rewards are granted per epoch and last **six epochs** (\~6 months). After this period, the plan will be revisited to adjust, end, or replenish as needed.

***

#### 2. Bonus Reward Criteria

To earn a yield bonus, holders must meet one or more of the following criteria:

* **Yield Series Holder** – Own at least 1 Yield NFT (Crocs, Paws, Gorillas). Each NFT can only qualify **1 PengOne**.
* **GATA DAO NFT Holder** – Own and stake at least 1 GATA DAO NFT (Colonial Cats or Voyager Cats). Each NFT can only qualify **10 PengOne**.
* **GATA Delegator** – Delegate at least **$100 worth of GATA** on any supported network. Each $100 qualifies 5 **PengOne**.

**Bonuses do not stack**. Meeting all three criteria grants a single **20% bonus** instead of 5% + 5% + 5%.

***

#### 3. General Conditions

* **Lock-in period**: Assets (Yield NFTs, DAO NFTs, delegated tokens) must be **committed before the epoch snapshot** . Marketplace-listed NFTs do not qualify.
* **One-to-one matching**: Each qualifying asset (NFT or $100 stake) can only be applied to the stated number of PengOnes during the bonus period.
* **Bonus cap**: No PengOne can receive more than a **20% bonus per epoch**.
