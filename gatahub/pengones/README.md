## Monthly Yield Revenue & Trait-Based Yield Distribution&#x20;

PengOne holders benefit from monthly distributions of revenue gained from the yield model activities, the so called **epoch rewards**. These are **$PHOTON $yGATA** which get distributed directly to the wallets of holders. You just need to hold your Crocs tightly: **no staking is needed** to be eligible for these monthly epoch rewards.

The **individual yield share per NFT** gets determined by the **Skin colors** of your Crocs. There are **5 different colors** with **5 different yield share values**. The rarer your Crocs, the higher your rewards:&#x20;
