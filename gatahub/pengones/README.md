## Utility of PengOnes&#x20;

• **Epoch Rewards** (70% of yield revenue gets distributed to PengOnes holders )

• **Yield Raffle** (10% of yield gets raffled with 3 random POs winning; each POs = 1 ticket)

## Monthly Yield Revenue & Trait-Based Yield Distribution&#x20;

PengOne holders benefit from monthly distributions of revenue gained from the yield model activities, the so called **epoch rewards**. The Yield gets distributed directly to the wallets of holders. You just need to hold your Penguines tightly: **no staking is needed** to be eligible for these monthly epoch rewards.

The **individual yield share per NFT** gets determined by the **Skin colors** of your Penguine. There are 3 **different yield share values**. and a super rare 1/1s. The rarer your penguine, the higher your rewards:&#x20;
