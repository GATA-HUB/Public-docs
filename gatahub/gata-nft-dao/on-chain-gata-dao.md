<summary>Why 3 DAOs? Why not go for one DAO and a few SubDAOs?</summary>

DAODAO doesn't support governance with/by staking of multiple NFT collections in one DAO yet. Because of this, we decided to go for separate DAOs for each collection. \
\
• The collection DAO's are the sole members of the main GATA DAO.\
\
• Therefore, holders of GATAc & GATAv vote directly on governance proposals of the Main DAO through their own DAOs & the result of each collection DAO will be passed as vote to main DAO, automatically.\
