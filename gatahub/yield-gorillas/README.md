# Yield Gorillas

### **Prologue & Lore of Yield Gorillas**

_There's a sense or logic to everything, right? So, how does Yield Gorilla comes in to play? How are they related to GATA? Who came first? All these questions are fitting!_&#x20;

> _"The saga of Gorillas is a bit different from GATA's: While GATAs are from greek era of gods and each GATA, as we have seen, possesses different powers, the Yield Gorillas are more of earthly creatures. They have lived and stayed in the common and modest habitat. This modest habitat is a place that belongs to everyone. You and me too, there is no royal patronage. Nonetheless, they are not scarce of royal blood. You may also observe that the habitat has affected the look of the gorillas. Their identity is not based on color but on their environment; a bear, a bull, a moon and many more. Yield Gorillas identify themselves in a unique way because they belong to a unique space. Unique, modest and sometimes a cruel space. In this diverse environment, the Gorillas have emerged to side with those who recognize value. Do you recognize value?"_

### Concept of Yield Gorillas & Yield Series

ï»¿Yield Gorillas are the first collection of non-GATA NFTs and belong to the Yield series. They consist of 10.000 YG NFTs that derive their value from revenue accrued via staking rewards and DeFi activities managed by the GATA team.&#x20;

The revenue from the mint got staked on [GATA validators](../gata-hub-ventures/gata-validators/) and the rewards collected from staking & DeFi activities are distributed to the holders of Yield Gorillas on a monthly base in so-called [YG epoch rewards](yg-reward-distributions.md), based on the rarity of their YGs.

### Yield Gorillas History

The minting of YGs began on November 16th 2022 in the order of whitelist categories. Community members of GATA DAO had been given priority for whitelisting as well as holders of both [GATA NFT series](../gata-nft-dao/about-gata-nfts/), all delegators to [GATA validators](../gata-hub-ventures/gata-validators/).

Around launch, GATA provided infos via [launch article on Medium](https://medium.com/gatadao/yield-gorillas-serie-is-here-4ae0c2423017) as well as various [minting scenarios](https://medium.com/gatadao/yield-gorilla-rewards-calculation-21dc924787e3).

The minting for whitelisted addresses (Category 1, 2 and 3) finished in 4, 4 and 12 hours respectively. The rest of the YGs minted out during public mint afterwards.
