# YG & Yield Concept

## Yield Series NFTs

Introducing the first non-GATA NFT series, the Yield Series will consist of multiple collections on different platforms across cosmos chains.&#x20;

* NFTs of Yield series collections derive their value from revenue accrued via staking rewards and DeFi activities managed by the GATA team.&#x20;
* The revenue from the mint of Yield series NFTs gets
  * a) staked on [GATA validators](../gata-validators/) to accrue staking rewards and&#x20;
  * b) put to work into DeFi activities that under direct supervision by the GATA team
* Holders of Yield series NFTs get rewards based on the afore-mentioned staking rewards and the performance of DeFi activities in so called [YG epoch rewards](yg-reward-distributions.md).
* Amount of epoch rewards per NFT is based on rarity. All holders get a baseline of epoch rewards, but certain NFT traits get a higher reward ([for YGs, this is based on the "skin" trait](./#concept-of-yield-gorillas-and-yield-series))
